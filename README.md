## A Little About Me
Hi there 👋 my name is Abhay. I am currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and City Planning. I am deeply passionate about public transportation (self-identifying NUMTOT 🏙), using and improving data 📊, and maps 🗺 (amongst many other interests). I got the idea to make a README profile from [Monica Powell](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme) and decided to give it a try!

My pronouns are he/him!

## Research


## Organizations

One of the highlights of my time in college has been [The Berkeley Forum](https://berkeleyforum.org/), a non-partisan forum that hosts speakers, debates, and panels on campus, completely free of charge to the public. As Vice President of the Moderating Committee, I have had the opportunity to train members in public speaking and question writing, as well as moderate for some really interesting folks, including:

- [Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxkvXcROS0&t=579s), Director of NIAID
- [Kate Wagner](https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyforum/videos/390362598390099), Creator of McMansion Hell
- [Karen Diver](https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyforum/videos/381620866076629), Former Special Assistant to President Obama on Native American Affairs
