## A Little About Me
Hi there üëã my name is Abhay. I am currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and City Planning. I am deeply passionate about public transportation (self-identifying NUMTOT üèô), using and improving data üìä, and maps üó∫ (amongst many other interests). I got the idea to make a README profile from [Monica Powell](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme) and decided to give it a try!

My pronouns are he/him!

## Research

Through **UC Berkeley's Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society** I have had the opportunity to research under multiple organizations and leads, working on projects from dataset analysis automation to predicting gentrification.

### [United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) 
I had the opportunity to work with a joint team (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Microsoft) on a [model](https://github.com/humanitarian-data-collaboration/hdx-python-model) that would predict [Humanitarian Exchange Language](https://hxlstandard.org/) (HXL) tags for datasets that were uploaded to the UN HDX. As a part of this I contributed to a [research paper](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/docs/Humanitarian_Data_tagging_KDD2019_SocialImpactTrack_HXLTagPrediction.pdf) detailing the methodology used for tag prediction and the efficacy of the project, whose findings were presented at [KDD 2019](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/).

I would be amiss not to credit the many people I learned from and worked with on this research project (my first as a college student), including my fellow student researchers at UC Berkeley, **Elisa Chen, Ruochen Liu, Anish Vankalyapati**, the professionals at Microsoft, **Vinitra Swamy and Vani Mandava**, and **Simon Johnson** at UN OCHA. 

### [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/)
This was a project under Professor Karen Chapple in the College of Environmental Design (CED), and was an offshoot of the Urban Displacement Project. The research objective was to develop a machine learning model to predict gentrification pressure by census tract in 4 cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Memphis) for use by metropolitan planning agencies. 

We presented a [final poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10NM98DpzLcqUNOqGOeswrT13YiWSuY88ThW1OLJqEJg/edit#slide=id.g25659b536c_2_6) at the end of the semester. Credits go to my fellow student researchers, Brian Le, Jacob Han, Kayli Jiang, Timothy Fong, as well as Ethan Burrell, who provided guidance throughout the project.

### [East Bay Community Energy](https://ebce.org/)

## Organizations

One of the highlights of my time in college has been [The Berkeley Forum](https://berkeleyforum.org/), a non-partisan forum that hosts speakers, debates, and panels on campus, completely free of charge to the public. As Vice President of the Moderating Committee, I have had the opportunity to train members in public speaking and question writing, as well as moderate for some really interesting folks, including:

- [Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxkvXcROS0&t=579s), Director of NIAID
- [Kate Wagner](https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyforum/videos/390362598390099), Creator of McMansion Hell
- [Karen Diver](https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyforum/videos/381620866076629), Former Special Assistant to President Obama on Native American Affairs
